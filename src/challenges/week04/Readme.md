##  <center>Javascript ES6 features

ECMAScript is a general-purpose programming language that is implemented in Javascript and some other languages. Basically it tells us how to write Javascript code across all platforms.

Think of ECMAScript as Javascript without a host environment. Javascript has two major environments: <mark> browsers and Node.js</mark>. These environments add some APIs to the language. An example is the window object on Browsers and the fs module in Node.js. If you strip all external APIs from these environments, you get ECMAScript (Pure Javascript).

ECMASCRIPT gets updated almost every year. However, In ES6(the 6th edition) some features were introduced to improve Javascript functionality. Some of them are templates, arrow functions, rest/spread operator, destructuring and some more. We're going to take a look at all of them. 
### Var, let, const
### Templates strings
### Arrow functions
### Rest/Spread operator
### Destructuring assignment
